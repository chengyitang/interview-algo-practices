| OOD: Let's say you're building a distributed system on AWS. Every single component (EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.) of the system generates logs. The logs are sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Design a function to read the logs from a certain time range and count the occurence of certain keywords like "Error" or "Warning". analyze_log(componenet_name, start_time, end_time, keywords) -> dict{keyword, count} | | ✅ |
| Let's say we are working on a shopping website and we want to analyze non returning users to offer them some promotions to get their attention again. We know that every user has their unique usernames, so we can track whether they are visiting the website again or not.
