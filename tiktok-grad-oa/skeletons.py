Skeleton Matching Problem

DESCRIPTION:
You are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters, and a list of strings 
`skeletons` consisting of '-' characters and lowercase English letters. Every `skeleton` will 
always be the same length as `word`.

TASK:
Your task is to return a list of skeletons that can form the given `word`. A skeleton can form 
a word if all '-' characters can be replaced with other characters taken from the same skeleton 
to make the string equal to the `word`. If no strings within `skeletons` can form the given 
`word` by doing this, return an empty list. The matching skeletons should be returned in the 
same order they appear in `skeletons` and the list of skeletons may not all be unique.

CONSTRAINTS:
- You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution
- A solution with time complexity not worse than O(skeletons.length x word.length^2) will fit 
  within the execution time limit

EXAMPLE:
For `word` = "hello" and `skeletons` = ["he-lo", "he--o", "-ell-", "hello"], 
the output should be `solution(word, skeletons)` = ["he-lo", "hello"]

EXPLANATION:

"he-lo" IS a skeleton of "hello":
- There is one '-' character, which should be an 'l'
- There is an 'l' in the skeleton in the fourth position
- The hyphen at index 2 in "he-lo" needs to be replaced by 'l' to form "hello". 
  The 'l' character is present in "he-lo" at index 3

"he--o" is NOT a skeleton of "hello":
- There are two '-' characters, which should both be 'l'
- But there are no 'l' characters in the skeleton
- The hyphens at indices 2 and 3 in "he--o" both need to be replaced by 'l' to form "hello". 
  However, the skeleton "he--o" does not contain the character 'l'

"-ell-" is NOT a skeleton of "hello":
- There are two '-' characters, which should both be 'h' and 'o' respectively
- But there are no 'h' and 'o' characters in the skeleton
- The hyphen at index 0 needs to be 'h' and the hyphen at index 4 needs to be 'o' to form "hello". 
  The skeleton "-ell-" does not contain 'h' or 'o'

ALGORITHM APPROACH:
1. For each skeleton in the list:
   - Check if it can form the target word
   - For each '-' in the skeleton, verify that the required character exists elsewhere in the skeleton
   - If all hyphens can be filled with characters from the same skeleton, include it in the result
2. Return the list of valid skeletons in their original order
